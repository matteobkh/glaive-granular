# Glaive Granular Sampler
Scans working directory for audio files, only supports WAV, FLAC and MP3. Once one is selected from the dropdown menu the sampler becomes visibile. `seemyface.wav` is a vocal sample generated by AI and is included for testing. FLAC and MP3 files seem to open normally but sound a little bit "weird", might just be the sound of the grains and will require some testing.
## Building
Current makefile works for MacOS (10.6+) and Linux. Clone repo and submodules with git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/matteobkh/glaive-granular. Then run `make install-portaudio` (or just `cd libs/portaudio && ./configure && make`) then just `make`. Make sure SDL2 is installed.
## To Do
- Refine GUI
- Pitch shifting option
- Reverse grain probability
- Fix time jitter (higher values cause clicks)
- Add sample chopping
- Add MIDI capability
